The Invoicing ROI Simulator will be a single-page web application that allows users to input key invoicing metrics, view instant ROI simulations, save scenarios, and download reports. It follows a clientâ€“server architecture with a RESTful API and a connected database for persistence.

Technologies & Frameworks

The frontend will be built using React.js with Tailwind CSS for a fast and responsive UI. The backend will use Node.js with Express.js to handle calculations, CRUD operations, and report generation. MongoDB will serve as the database for storing scenarios and emails. pdfkit will be used to generate downloadable reports.
The application will be hosted online, with the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render or Railway.

Key Features

Quick Simulation: Users enter business metrics and instantly view cost savings, ROI, and payback.

Scenario Management: Save, retrieve, and delete simulations from the database.

Report Generation: Generate a downloadable PDF report after providing an email.

Backend Logic: Internal constants ensure automation always shows favorable ROI.

Hosting: Deployed online with persistent storage via MongoDB Atlas.

System Architecture :

The application follows a three-tier architecture consisting of the frontend, backend, and database layers.

Frontend (React.js):
The frontend provides an interactive single-page interface where users can enter invoicing details, view instant ROI results, and manage scenarios. It communicates with the backend through REST API calls for all simulations, CRUD operations, and report generation.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js):
The backend processes all business logic and calculations using internal constants that ensure automation benefits. It exposes REST endpoints such as /simulate, /scenarios, and /report/generate. It also handles validation, applies the ROI bias factor, and manages PDF report creation.

Database (MongoDB):
MongoDB stores saved scenarios, user-provided emails for report downloads, and other relevant data. The backend connects to MongoDB via Mongoose for smooth data operations.

Hosting and Deployment:
The frontend will be deployed on Vercel for quick public access, while the backend will be hosted on Render or Railway. The MongoDB Atlas cloud database will ensure persistent data storage and scalability.
